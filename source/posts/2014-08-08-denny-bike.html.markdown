This bike just blow me of. Can you imagine a bike with lights and lock as part of the bike itself. On top of this it has rubber bristles to protect you from getting wet without using a mudguard. How awesome is that? Denny is the winner of "The Bike Design Project" and will soon be produced from [Fuji Bikes](http://www.fujibikes.com/).

To get an idea of how awesome Denny the - all in one - bike is, watch this: [Teague x Sizemore bicyles's Denny](http://vimeo.com/101360481)
