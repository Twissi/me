Mrs. Henry and the Flying Fish got me at their performance at parque del sol in St.PÃ¶lten. It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining, the park with all its decoration and people created a wonderful atmosphere and on top of that the voice of Mrs. Henry made this moment perfect. If you enjoy acoustic-pop than go for it.
