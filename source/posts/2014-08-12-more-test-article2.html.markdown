I currently have a loop, that, by measuring passed time in nanoseconds, runs the game logic and rendering logic at predefined speeds without a problem. In fact any logic I do in the loop is clocked to a certain amount of calls each second.

The loop itself though just runs about as fast as it likes to which comes up to around 11.7 million loops a second on my machine.
