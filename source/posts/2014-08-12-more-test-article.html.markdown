Edit: Using Thread.sleep() to e.g. Throttle the main loop down to 250 loops per second leads to a reduction but the loops runs at around 570 loops per second instead of the desired 250 (will add code when I'm at my desktop machine..)

Edit: Here we go, a working java gameloop in order to clarify things. Also feel free to use it but don't claim it yours ;)
